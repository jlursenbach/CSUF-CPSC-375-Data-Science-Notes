# Time Series:

## A time series is a sequence of observations made over time.

### Examples:

Stock market prices (for a single stock every day)
Heart rate of a patient over time
Position of one or multiple people/cars/airplanes over time
Speech: represented as a sequence of audio measurements at discrete time steps
A musical melody: represented as a sequence of pairs (note, duration)

## Applications of Time Series Classification

Stock market prices (for a single stock every day)
- Sell/Hold/Buy?
Heart rate of a patient over time:
- a healthy heart, or diseased?
Position of people/cars/airplanes over time
- Predict congestion along a route suggested by the GPS
Speech recognition
Music recognition
- Sing a tune to your phone, have it recognize the song
- Recognize the genre of a song based on how it sounds
